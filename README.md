This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The To Do app. I used this project as a way to really get my head around and learn React, and of course a chance to build one that I ACTUALLY want to use. I like the simplicity of paper and pen, nothing fancy. So I want a to do app that takes that simplicity and improves upon it for the web.
